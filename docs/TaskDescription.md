# Create an ASP.NET Core-based application that performs the following tasks:

	- Booking a rental car for the cities of Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart (the car must be returned in the same city).
	- At least 5 different vehicles should be available for selection at each location (you can choose which ones).
	- The rental period can be selected by the day (e.g., August 1st to August 5th), but cannot be in the past.
	- If a vehicle is already rented at a location for a specific period, it cannot be booked there during that timeframe.
	
# Nice to have:
	- A user interface (preferably MudBlazor) for booking with a small grid or table (otherwise, "Scribble" would also be acceptable).
	- Rebooking/cancellation of a booking
	- A small flowchart
